## Description

This project is a webpage similar to Twitter where users can login and see a news feed of different posts from different users. An admin can have special access to a dashboard where they can manage posts and users. Users can like or report posts. They can access their own profile as well to change any information. A user cannot access admin dashboard. Admin dashboard can show last time they were on the dashboard. Reported posts are flagged and can be suspended through admin.
