## Description

This project is a webpage similar to Twitter where users can login and see a news feed of different posts from different users. An admin can have special access to a dashboard where they can manage posts and users. Users can like or report posts. They can access their own profile as well to change any information. A user cannot access admin dashboard. Admin dashboard can show last time they were on the dashboard. Reported posts are flagged and can be suspended through admin. 


## Getting Started

Download or clone the folder onto your machine. Ensure you have a server running like MAMP, and download the folder into the proper place on your machine for the localhost to open. Open this folder through localhost to begin.

### Prerequisites

Are there any dependencies? Are there things to keep in mind when testing this code?


This code depends on the database given: 2170-w22. You need to keep in mind that the login information as well as all user information is dependent on what is held within that database. 
For example, one cannot login with their own credentials unless those credentials are in the login table.
